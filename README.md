Ensure that Node.js is already installed on your system. It is available for download at nodejs.org.


Create a file containing the script, such as prime_collision_predictor.js.


Enter "command prompt" or "terminal" followed by the path to the directory containing the script.


Utilise the subsequent commands:

npm init -y        // This will initialize a package.json file (if you don't have one already)

npm install fs    // This will install the fs module

node prime_collision_predictor.js


The script will generate the output array and save it to 'output.json'.
